# zig
- we are using zig 0.14.1

# Usage of the Makefile
- You must use the @Makefile to run build commands.
- DO dynamically control logging verbosity per module.
- DO store useful comparison commands in the Makefile.


# Heuristics

- If you think a heuristic is useful, then you are definetly wrong and this means we are taking a wrong approach.
- Format is fully deterministic. You MUST consider breaking out of local maxima in case you try to use heuristics.
- Try to avoid allocating "reasonable" amounts of memory. You should have information from the binary format to know how much memory to allocate.
- Many of the errors you will see are because we are interpreting wrong values as some other binxml stuff, which can cause huge offsets, jumps etc.
- Avoid fallbacks, these again mean you have not understood the format or our approach is wrong.

# Templates and substitutions

- Always keep in mind that we have some extra bits of state regarding templates and substitutions.
- They could be nested
- in case of nesting, some binary fields may not be present.
